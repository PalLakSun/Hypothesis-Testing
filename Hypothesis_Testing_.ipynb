        "1. What is a null hypothesis (H₀) and why is it important in hypothesis testing?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans-A null hypothesis (denoted as H₀) is a fundamental concept in statistical hypothesis testing. It's a statement or assumption that there is no effect or no difference between groups, or that a relationship does not exist between the variables being studied. It essentially proposes that any observed effect in the data is due to chance or random variation, rather than a true underlying phenomenon.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "If you're testing whether a new drug has an effect on blood pressure, the null hypothesis (H₀) might state that the drug has no effect on blood pressure ( any difference observed in blood pressure is due to random chance).\n",
        "\n",
        "Why is the Null Hypothesis Important?\n",
        "\n",
        "1.Starting Point for Testing: The null hypothesis provides a baseline or default assumption that you can either reject or fail to reject based on the data. It's a starting point for drawing conclusions about the population.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.Objectivity: Hypothesis testing is about being objective and unbiased. The null hypothesis serves as a \"neutral\" position, against which any new evidence (data) can be tested. You test whether the evidence supports an alternative hypothesis (H₁), which is typically what you're trying to prove.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.Decision Making: Hypothesis testing helps you make informed decisions. You use statistical tests to either reject the null hypothesis (if the evidence is strong enough) or fail to reject it (if the evidence isn't strong enough). This helps scientists and researchers decide whether their findings are meaningful or just random occurrences.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What does the significance level (α) represent in hypothesis testing?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans-The significance level (denoted as α, often referred to as alpha) is a threshold used in hypothesis testing to determine whether the observed data provides enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis. It essentially sets the standard for how much evidence you need before concluding that the observed effect is statistically significant.\n",
        "\n",
        "What does α represent?\n",
        "\n",
        "The significance level, α, represents the probability of making a Type I error, which means rejecting a true null hypothesis (a false positive). In other words, it's the risk you're willing to take that the results you're seeing are due to random chance rather than a real effect.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, if you set α = 0.05 (a common choice), you are allowing a 5% chance of incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis when it's actually true. This is like saying, \"I'm willing to accept that 5% of the time, I might get a false positive.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Interpreting the Alpha-\n",
        "\n",
        "α = 0.05: This is the most commonly used significance level. It means that there is a 5% chance of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true.\n",
        "\n",
        "α = 0.01: This represents a more stringent test, where you are only willing to accept a 1% chance of making a Type I error.\n",
        "\n",
        "α = 0.10: A less strict significance level, allowing for a 10% chance of Type I error. This might be used in exploratory studies where you're willing to take a higher risk of false positives.\n",
